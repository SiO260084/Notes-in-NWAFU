# Paragraph Cohesion Exercise: Reverse Outlining

## 1. 提出PD与心血管疾病（AMI, CHD, EVD）的潜在关联，并引用男性AMI风险研究。

1. **Over the last decades, there has been an accumulation of evidence suggesting that ==periodontal disease== may possibly contribute to the development of ==acute myocardial infarction (AMI)==, ==coronary heart disease (CHD)==, and ==cardiovascular disease (EVD)==.** Findings from several studies suggest the association between periodontal disease and an increased risk for AMI in men. [4-5]

> 在过去几十年中，越来越多的证据表明，牙周病可能在一定程度上促进急性心肌梗死（AMI）、冠心病（CHD）和心血管疾病（CVD）的发生。多项研究的结果提示，牙周病与男性急性心肌梗死风险升高之间存在关联。[4-5]

## 2. 定义PD，描述其作为一种慢性病的性质和极高的患病率。

2. ==Periodontal disease== is a slowly progressive chronic infectious and inflammatory disease that results in the destruction of bone that supports teeth. Periodontal disease seems to be the most prevalent chronic disease affecting as many as 75 percent of adults over the age of 30.[6]

> 牙周病是一种缓慢进展的慢性感染性和炎症性疾病，可导致支撑牙齿的骨组织破坏。牙周病似乎是成年人中最普遍的慢性疾病之一，影响多达75%的30岁以上成年人。[6]

## 3. 阐述PD导致MI的生物学机制（病原体、炎症介质导致动脉粥样硬化）。

3. Several hypothetical mechanism that have been proposed suggest that periodontal bacterial pathogens,endotoxins, and inflammatory mediators found in the oral cavity and in the blood stream of people contribute to the platelet aggregation and atherosclerotic plaque formation in coronary blood vessels. [7-10] Therefore, individuals with elevated inflammatory responses to periodontal infection might be at increased risk for a myocardial infarction.[11]

> 已有若干假说机制被提出，认为口腔及血液中发现的牙周致病菌、内毒素和炎症介质可能促进冠状血管内血小板聚集和动脉粥样硬化斑块的形成。[7-10] 因此，对牙周感染产生较强炎症反应的个体，可能面临更高的心肌梗死风险。[11]

4. Recent studies suggest an association between periodontal and coronary heart disease, even after adjustment for potential confounding variables thus representing a potential association between periodontal disease and AMI. (2,13)However, other studies have found no such association. [14-16]

> 近期研究提示，即使在调整了潜在混杂变量之后，牙周病与冠心病之间仍存在关联，这表明牙周病与急性心肌梗死之间可能存在某种联系。[2,13] 然而，也有其他研究未能发现此类关联。[14-16]

5. Thus, the issue of the association between periodontal disease and coronary heart disease remains controversial.Possible explanations could be related to the level of validity of the studies. For example, many studies that found positive association between periodontal disease and myocardial infarction have had small, selected samples.[3.4.17]In addition, some studies have included a high proportion of older men, which may create a certain bias in results,since AMI and CHD are common causes of morbidity and mortality among elderly people.

> 因此，牙周病与冠心病之间是否存在关联这一问题仍存在争议。可能的解释与研究本身的效度水平有关。例如，许多发现牙周病与心肌梗死呈正相关的研究，其样本量较小且具有选择性。[3,4,17] 此外，部分研究纳入了较高比例的老年男性，这可能导致结果偏倚，因为急性心肌梗死和冠心病在老年人群中本就是常见致病和致死原因。

6. Finally, studies use various measures of periodontal disease, attachment loss, periodontal indices and even selfreported measures of periodontal disease.[5] Few studies utilized clinical measures of periodontal disease with direct measure of periodontal infection, such as bacterial counts or serum antibody levels. [18] Therefore, our study aims to address some of the issues in existing research: a population-based sample will be used to examine an association between periodontal disease and the incidence of the first subsequent myocardial infarction in males 35-69 years old in Ontario; subgroup analysis according to age will be carried out; periodontal disease will be measured using a more comprehensive assessment, including blood cultures, IgG antibody tests and standardized clinical examination;examine whether the severity of periodontal disease might increase the risk of AMI.

> 最后，不同研究对牙周病的测量方式各异，包括附着丧失程度、牙周指数，甚至采用受试者自我报告的牙周病状况。[5] 很少有研究采用临床指标直接评估牙周感染，例如细菌计数或血清抗体水平。[18] 因此，本研究旨在解决现有研究中的若干问题：我们将使用基于人群的样本，考察安大略省35至69岁男性中牙周病与首次后续心肌梗死发生之间的关联；按年龄进行亚组分析；采用更全面的牙周病评估方法，包括血培养、IgG抗体检测和标准化临床检查；并进一步探讨牙周病的严重程度是否会增加急性心肌梗死的风险。

7. The main hypothesis of the study is that periodontal disease may increase the risk of subsequent acute myocardial infarction among middle-aged men in Ontario, who have no previous history of coronary heart disease, stroke,transient cerebral ischemia, and cancer. The main objective of this study proposal is to examine whether there is an association between periodontal disease and the subsequent incidence of AMI among middle aged men in Ontario.a

> 本研究的主要假设是：在既往无冠心病、卒中、短暂性脑缺血发作或癌症病史的安大略省中年男性中，牙周病可能会增加后续发生急性心肌梗死的风险。本研究提案的主要目标是探讨安大略省中年男性中牙周病与后续急性心肌梗死发病率之间是否存在关联。
